“Surface” is a 2.5D Puzzle Platformer in which the player controls 
Tomas, a cat-person sorcerer who has washed ashore in a cave. 
Players will jump, climb, and grapple between two different worlds 
as they try and escape from the cave and reach the surface. 
What awaits in the world above? Only time will tell.
